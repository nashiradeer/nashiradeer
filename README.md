Hello! I'm Deyvid da Silva Costa (any pronoun), also known as Nashira Deer, and I'm a Brazilian software developer and stundent at the Catholic University of Bras√≠lia. Currently, my stack is made up of Rust, Go, Elixir, TypeScript, React, Svelte, Dart, and C#, with frameworks and tools like Next.js, SvelteKit, Unity, and Flutter, but I'm always looking for new technologies that'll make me learn a new way of thinking. My best quality is my ability to determine, learn, and use the best tools for the project. I love programming, and talking about it, so feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat about anything related to software development, or if you need help with a project, you can find on the social media links below or on Discord (nashiradeer) and Telegram (@nashiradeer).
