# Hello! I am Nashira Deer!

Well, actually this is the nickname chosen by me to represent myself, in fact, my name is Deyvid da Silva Costa, but if you prefer, you can also call me Kitsune, the nickname my closest friends call me. Personally, I like Kitsune, but all names are equally valid.

## Story

Despite being interested in computers since childhood, it was only in 2019 that I actually started to study programming, starting with JavaScript, developing bots for Discord using only a cell phone with Termux and DroidEdit installed, since then I have been studying computing, always looking for something new to learn.
