Hello, I'm Deyvid da Silva Costa (Brazilian, 19y, she/her), or Kitsu'ne on the internet. You can find me using the name of Nashira Deer, but it's a "legacy" name. I prefer Kitsu'ne to my real name or Nashira. I'm a software developer who loves to code back-ends, games, or system-related things, using Rust or C# with Unity in these projects, but I also code front-end in TypeScript and mobile/desktop in Flutter. My favorite programming languages are Rust, Elixir, Go, C, C#, and TypeScript.

## Story

However being interested in computers since childhood (2016), it was only in 2019 that I started to study programming, starting with JavaScript, developing bots for Discord using only a cell phone with Termux and DroidEdit installed, since then I have been studying computing, always looking for something new to learn.
